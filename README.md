cloudify-logstash-plugin
========================

* Master Branch [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-logstash-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-logstash-plugin)

This plugin is currently under development. It does not yet provide any functionality.

This plugin will provide a neat way of:

- Installing logstash (deb or rpm based installations for now)
- Apply a given configuration with the option to configure sending the logs to Cloudify's RabbitMQ nodes.
